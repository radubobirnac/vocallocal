## Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Button Sizes and Spacing
- Made the recording and upload buttons more compact by reducing padding and font size
- Changed button text from "Start Recording" to just "Record" and "Upload Audio" to "Upload"
- Made the translate buttons icon-only to save space
- Reduced the gap between buttons from 1rem to 0.5rem

### 2. Increased Transcription Display Area
- Increased the minimum height of the transcription text area from 200px to 250px
- Increased the maximum height from 300px to 350px
- Reduced padding from 1rem to 0.75rem to maximize content area
- Increased the translation text area height as well

### 3. Optimized Layout for Bilingual Mode
- Reduced the gap between speaker cards from 1.5rem to 1rem (0.75rem on desktop)
- Increased the maximum width of the bilingual container from 800px to 900px
- Made the card headers more compact with smaller font size and reduced padding

### 4. Reduced Spacing Around Time Limit Notice
- Made the time limit notice more compact by reducing padding and font size
- Reduced the margin below the notice from 0.5rem to 0.25rem

### 5. Improved Responsive Design
- Kept buttons side-by-side on tablets but stacked them on small mobile devices
- Added specific optimizations for mobile view with reduced padding and font sizes
- Ensured transcription areas remain prominent on mobile devices

### 6. Additional Mobile Optimizations
- Further reduced padding from 0.5rem to 0.35rem in the time limit notice
- Removed bottom margin to make it more compact
- Reduced font size from 1.25rem to 1.1rem in speaker headers
- Reduced padding from 0.5rem to 0.35rem in speaker headers
- Reduced bottom margin from 0.75rem to 0.5rem in speaker headers
- Reduced spacing between header and language selection
- Reduced font size from 0.85rem to 0.8rem in language selection
- Reduced padding in the dropdown from 0.35rem to 0.25rem
- Reduced bottom margin from 0.75rem to 0.5rem in language selection
- Made the recording button smaller by reducing padding from 0.5rem to 0.4rem
- Reduced font size from 0.8rem to 0.75rem in the recording button
- Adjusted the flex ratio to 0.85 to give more emphasis to content
- Replaced the text "Upload" button with a small paperclip icon
- Created a circular button design using the `.upload-icon-only` class
- Reduced the flex ratio to 0.15 to make it much smaller
- Added appropriate styling for the icon-only version
- Reduced the gap between elements from 0.5rem to 0.25rem in recording controls
- Reduced bottom margin from 0.75rem to 0.5rem in recording controls

These changes collectively create a much more compact interface that's better optimized for mobile viewing, with significantly more emphasis on the transcription content rather than the UI controls.
