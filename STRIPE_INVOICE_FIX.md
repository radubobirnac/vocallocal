# Stripe Invoice Configuration Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified

The error occurred because we were trying to manually enable invoice creation in a Stripe checkout session set to `subscription` mode:

```
ERROR: You can only enable invoice creation when `mode` is set to `payment`. 
Invoices are created automatically when `mode` is set to `subscription`
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Manual Invoice Creation from Checkout Session
**File:** `services/payment_service.py`

- **Removed** the `invoice_creation` configuration from checkout session
- **Reason:** Stripe automatically creates invoices for subscription mode
- **Result:** Checkout sessions now work correctly

### 2. Added Invoice Customization via Webhook
**File:** `services/payment_service.py`

- **Added** `invoice.created` webhook handler
- **Added** `_handle_invoice_created()` method to customize invoices after creation
- **Features:**
  - Adds custom description with plan type
  - Adds custom fields for service identification
  - Adds professional footer with support contact
  - Adds metadata for tracking

### 3. Updated Tests
**File:** `test_complete_invoice_system.py`

- **Updated** Stripe checkout configuration test
- **Added** invoice creation handler test
- **Result:** All 4/4 tests passing

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Before (Causing Error):
```python
session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
    # ... other params ...
    mode='subscription',
    invoice_creation={  # ❌ This caused the error
        'enabled': True,
        'invoice_data': { ... }
    }
)
```

### After (Working Solution):
```python
# 1. Checkout session without manual invoice creation
session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
    # ... other params ...
    mode='subscription'  # ✅ Invoices created automatically
)

# 2. Customize invoices via webhook when they're created
def _handle_invoice_created(self, invoice):
    stripe.Invoice.modify(
        invoice['id'],
        description=f'VocalLocal {plan_type.title()} Plan Subscription',
        custom_fields=[...],
        footer='Thank you for choosing VocalLocal!'
    )
```

## 🎯 Benefits of New Approach

1. **Compliance with Stripe API** - No more errors during checkout
2. **Automatic Invoice Generation** - Stripe handles invoice creation
3. **Custom Branding** - Invoices still get VocalLocal branding via webhook
4. **Better Error Handling** - Customization failures don't break payment flow
5. **More Reliable** - Uses Stripe's recommended approach

## 📋 Webhook Events Now Handled

- `checkout.session.completed` - Process successful payments
- `customer.subscription.created` - Handle new subscriptions
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Handle subscription changes
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Handle cancellations
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Send payment confirmation emails
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Handle payment failures
- **`invoice.created`** - ✨ **NEW:** Customize invoice branding
