# VocalLocal Payment Email System Fixes - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully resolved critical post-payment email functionality issues in the VocalLocal payment system. The fixes ensure that payment confirmation emails display correct plan names and include professionally formatted PDF invoice attachments.

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Incorrect Plan Name Mapping in Payment Confirmation Emails
**Problem**: Payment confirmation emails showed "Unknown Plan" instead of correct plan names
**Root Cause**: Insufficient fallback logic in plan name detection from Stripe data
**Solution**: Enhanced plan name mapping with multiple detection methods

### Issue 2: Missing PDF Invoice Generation
**Problem**: No PDF invoice generation and attachment functionality
**Root Cause**: Missing PDF generation service and email attachment capability
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive PDF invoice generation with professional layout
